# solovay_strassen
Probabilistic test to determine if a given number is composite or probably prime.

This test has been largely superseded by the Baillie-PSW primality test and the Miller–Rabin primality test, but has great historical importance in showing the practical feasibility of the RSA cryptosystem. The Solovay–Strassen test is essentially an Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime test.

The compexity of the algoritmh is RP.
